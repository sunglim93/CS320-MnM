After pressing the attack button, a quick time event will pop up that determines the amount of damage that the enemy will take. During the QTE, the player must left click when the red line aligns with the blue square. The square turn green if the player left clicked at the correct time otherwise the square will turn red.

	4. combat
	5. room selection
	6. shop or another combat encounter
	7. after 3 combat encounters->boss screen
	8. After the boss room is complete there's a chance the player may get a minigame room. If the player completes the minigame room without failing, they'll be sent to a reward state.
	9. victory screen
	10. restart

When a player selects the ??? path, they may encounter another combat screen even if they have had 3 encounters. This will continue until the player randomly encounters/chooses the shop screen. After leaving the shop, the player will then encounter a boss battle.
